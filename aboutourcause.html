  <p style="margin-left: 25px">		According to Matthew Palmer, one of Columbia University’s senior lecturers: “We (humans) have had by far the most transformative and negative impact on this planet.” Throughout eternity the environment has suffered the consequences of human actions ranging from the burning of fossil fuels to deforestation.When the population of the human race was rather small, the magnitude of these actions were not large enough to have a detrimental effect on the environment however, the population has changed. According to PRB.org, in the year 2019 the earth was home to 7.7 billion people. A large portion of this population is consumer to some extent and therefore, a contributor to climate change and the depletion of earth’s wonderful resources. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px">	Climate change is due to the increased prevalence of the greenhouse effect caused by humans which is essentially the warming of the earth caused by the entrapment of gasses in the earth’s atmosphere therefore, increasing earth’s temperature. Specifically, the burning of specific fossil fuels like oil and coal for the production of energy have been the direct cause of the greenhouse effect. The humans’ provocation of the greenhouse effect has many dire consequences with regards to earth. One of these consequences is that glaciers and ice caps will melt due to the warming of oceans resulting in higher sea levels thus causing the destruction of various property and infrastructure. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px">In today’s society, so many goods that us humans purchase every day are non-recyclable and have a limited product life-span. Furthermore, these products are packaged using, again, non-recyclable materials which are immediately thrown into the trash. Many different places deal with trash differently. The concept of a landfill, a large hole with the main purpose of congregating trash in this hole generates methane gas therefore contributing to the greenhouse effect and again climate change. Additionally, another option for waste management is incineration but, due to the fact that plastics are made of so many harmful chemicals, large amounts of air pollution is released through the burning of these plastics. Additionally, it is important to note that manufacturing these products requires energy which is often produced by fossil fuels thus once again contributing to climate change. Lastly, the most devastating place where disposable waste is placed is the ocean. Dumping consumer trash into the ocean is very harmful to aquatic life and has resulted in the decrease and even extensions of certain species due to this disgusting practice. </p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px">If us humans continue to live our lives with little to no respect for the environment, the world will cease to exist very shortly and even sooner, the living standards for the next generation will not match the quality that <b>us</b>, the current generation, live in.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px">At Upper Canada College, the quest to a greener future to prevent climate change and limit waste is a desired one. Home to roughly one thousand students, the college itself has a significant impact on the environment and through this questionnaire that we have created, you can improve your effect on the environment.</p>

  <p style="margin-left: 25px"><b>Our mission</b> is to educate the population on what choices/aspects of their lives negatively impact the environment and what they can do to limit the impact they have on the environment in order to sustain the earth’s ability to be a lovely habitat where humans and other species can live.</p>
